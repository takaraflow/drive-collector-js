## 2024-05-18 - [Add human-readable file sizes]
**Learning:** Hardcoding MB as the unit for file sizes (`(bytes / 1048576).toFixed(1) + " MB"`) leads to unreadable 0.0 MB for very small files and bloated numbers for multi-gigabyte files (e.g. 2560.0 MB instead of 2.5 GB), impacting UX in progress indicators and file listings.
**Action:** Created a `formatBytes` utility in `src/utils/common.js` to automatically scale byte counts into B, KB, MB, GB, etc. with appropriate precision, improving readability across the UI (`renderProgress` and `renderFilesPage`).
## 2026-04-28 - Improve Empty State UX with Actionable CTAs
**Learning:** Conversational bot UI empty states (like 'no tasks' or 'empty directory') must include clear, context-specific call-to-actions (CTAs) instead of reusing generalized strings, guiding the user on what to do next.
**Action:** Always provide specific, actionable instructions in empty states rather than just stating there is no data, avoiding the reuse of generic messages across different contexts.
## 2026-05-05 - [Actionable Empty States]
**Learning:** Empty states without clear next steps leave users confused. For example, "任务已不存在或无权操作" simply informs of a failure without offering a path forward.
**Action:** Empty state messages should always provide a clear, context-specific call-to-action (CTA) to guide users on what to do next. For instance, suggesting they use a specific command like `/drive` to re-bind or send a media group.
