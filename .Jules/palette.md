## 2024-05-18 - [Add human-readable file sizes]
**Learning:** Hardcoding MB as the unit for file sizes (`(bytes / 1048576).toFixed(1) + " MB"`) leads to unreadable 0.0 MB for very small files and bloated numbers for multi-gigabyte files (e.g. 2560.0 MB instead of 2.5 GB), impacting UX in progress indicators and file listings.
**Action:** Created a `formatBytes` utility in `src/utils/common.js` to automatically scale byte counts into B, KB, MB, GB, etc. with appropriate precision, improving readability across the UI (`renderProgress` and `renderFilesPage`).
## 2026-04-28 - Improve Empty State UX with Actionable CTAs
**Learning:** Conversational bot UI empty states (like 'no tasks' or 'empty directory') must include clear, context-specific call-to-actions (CTAs) instead of reusing generalized strings, guiding the user on what to do next.
**Action:** Always provide specific, actionable instructions in empty states rather than just stating there is no data, avoiding the reuse of generic messages across different contexts.

## 2024-05-24 - Empty State Call-to-Action
**Learning:** In conversational bot interfaces like Telegram bots, empty states (e.g., "no tasks") must provide actionable Call-to-Actions instructing the user on what to do next (like "send files directly"), rather than just stating there is no data.
**Action:** Always verify that empty state messages in `src/locales/zh-CN.js` include actionable CTAs relevant to their context.
